        <h2 className="subheading">Introduction to Bee Farming:</h2>
        <p className="text">
          Bee farming, also known as apiculture, is the practice of keeping and managing bee colonies for honey production, pollination services, and other bee products like beeswax and royal jelly. With the rapid advancement of technology, beekeepers can now integrate various tech solutions to monitor and enhance bee health, manage hives more effectively, and improve productivity. In this guide, we will explore how technology can play a pivotal role in modern bee farming practices.
        </p>

        <h2 className="subheading">The Importance of Bee Farming:</h2>
        <p className="text">
          Bees are crucial for pollination, which supports the production of many of the fruits, vegetables, and seeds we rely on for food. Apart from honey production, bees also help in pollinating plants and flowers, contributing to biodiversity. Bee farming not only provides economic benefits to farmers but also helps in sustaining global food production systems.
        </p>

        <h2 className="subheading">Technological Tools in Bee Farming:</h2>

        <p className="text">
          With the advent of smart agriculture, technology has significantly transformed bee farming. Some of the tools that have revolutionized the field include:
        </p>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">1. Hive Monitoring Systems:</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            Hive monitoring systems include sensors that track temperature, humidity, and weight of the hives, providing real-time data to beekeepers. This helps in detecting any abnormalities such as sudden drops in weight, which could indicate a honey theft or a potential health issue among the bees.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">2. Digital Bee Health Monitoring:</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            Sensors placed inside the hives can track bee behavior, such as the activity level of bees and the presence of diseases or pests. With advanced AI algorithms, these systems can alert the beekeeper about any potential threats or health issues before they become major problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">3. Automated Hive Management:</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            Automation tools allow beekeepers to control hive temperature, ventilation, and humidity levels from a mobile device. This ensures optimal conditions for the bees, improving their productivity and overall health.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">4. GPS for Hive Location Tracking:</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            GPS-enabled devices help beekeepers track the locations of their hives, ensuring that they are placed in areas with ample forage and away from hazardous zones. This helps in improving bee productivity and prevents loss of hives due to theft or misplacement.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">5. Drones in Bee Farming:</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            Drones can be used to monitor the health of beehives, detect pests, and even help in the pollination process. They are especially useful in large-scale bee farming operations, where it's difficult to manually monitor each hive.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="subheading">Challenges Faced in Bee Farming:</h2>
        <p className="text">
          While bee farming offers numerous benefits, it is not without challenges. Some common issues faced by beekeepers include:
        </p>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">1. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD):</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            CCD is a phenomenon where the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear, leaving behind the queen, food, and a few nurse bees. This can be caused by various factors, including pesticide use, disease, and environmental stressors.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">2. Disease and Pest Control:</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            Bees are vulnerable to various diseases and pests, such as the Varroa mite. These pests can weaken the bee colony and affect honey production. Beekeepers need to use both organic and tech-based solutions to monitor and treat diseases and pests effectively.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="pointContainer">
          <h3 className="pointTitle">3. Climate Change:</h3>
          <p className="pointDescription">
            Changes in climate, including rising temperatures and altered rainfall patterns, can affect the availability of forage for bees. It can also cause shifts in the timing of flowering plants, disrupting the bees' natural foraging patterns.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="subheading">Sustainable Practices in Bee Farming:</h2>
